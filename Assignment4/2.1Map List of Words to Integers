"""2.1 Write a Python program using function concept that maps list of words into a list of integers
representing the lengths of the corresponding words.
Hint: If a list [ ab,cde,erty] is passed on to the python function output should come as [2,3,4]
Here 2,3 and 4 are the lengths of the words in the list."""
